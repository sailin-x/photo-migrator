# Test Suite Build Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Fixed `XCTestManifests.swift`**:
   - Added missing test class references:
     - `ArchiveProcessorTests.allTests`
     - `LivePhotoProcessorTests.allTests`
   - This ensures all test classes are included in the test manifest for Linux testing.

2. **Project Structure Analysis**:
   - Identified the underlying issue of duplicate Swift files in different locations:
     - Files in `PhotoMigrator/` directory
     - Duplicate files in `PhotoMigrator/Sources/PhotoMigrator/` directory
   - Created a detailed analysis in `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`

3. **Created Reorganization Tools**:
   - Added `scripts/reorganize_project.sh` to help reorganize the project structure
   - The script moves source files to the standard Swift Package Manager structure
   - This script can be run to eliminate duplicate sources

4. **Package.swift Update**:
   - Temporarily updated `Package.swift` to explicitly exclude the `Sources` directory
   - Created a clean version of `Package.swift` for future use after reorganization

## Build Status

While we've fixed the specific issue with the `XCTestManifests.swift` file, the project still has build issues due to the underlying duplicate file problem. To fully fix the build:

1. Run the reorganization script: `./scripts/reorganize_project.sh`
2. Replace `Package.swift` with the clean version found in the reorganization script
3. Run `swift build` to verify the build works with the new structure

## Next Steps for Test Suite

After fixing the build issues:

1. Complete implementation of missing test cases
2. Add test coverage for edge cases
3. Implement integration tests for key workflows
4. Set up UI tests for critical user journeys

## Test Classes Status

| Test Class | Status | Notes |
