# Progress - PhotoMigrator

## Completed Work
- Set up TaskMaster for project management:
  - Initialized TaskMaster project
  - Configured AI models (Claude 3.7 Sonnet as main, Deep Research as research, GPT-4o as fallback)
  - Created initial tasks based on project requirements
  - Generated task files
- Created memory-bank directory structure
- Populated memory-bank with initial project documentation:
  - Project Brief
  - Product Context
  - System Patterns
  - Tech Context
  - Active Context
  - Progress (this file)
- Implemented core architecture (Task 1)
- Created basic UI implementation (Task 2)
- Implemented Google Takeout archive processing (Task 3)
- Developed metadata extraction and parsing system (Task 4)
- Implemented photo library integration (Task 5)
- Implemented album organization (Task 6)
- Created progress tracking system (Task 7)
- Implemented background processing (Task 8)
- Created error handling system (Task 9)
- Implemented logging and diagnostics (Task 10)
- Added user preferences (Task 11)
- Created installer and documentation (Task 12)

## In Progress
- Compatibility and testing improvements (Task 13):
  - ✅ Restructured project to follow Swift Package Manager conventions (Task 13.1)
  - ✅ Fixed circular imports between modules (Task 13.2)
  - ✅ Standardized error handling across modules (Task 13.3)
  - ✅ Fixed memory management issues (Task 13.4)
  - ✅ Implemented comprehensive MemoryMonitor class with proper testing (Task 13.5)
  - ▶️ Continuing with compatibility fixes for SwiftUI and AppKit interfaces (Task 13.6)
  - ▶️ Implementing test suite for core components (Task 13.7)
  - ▶️ Fixing type safety issues (Task 13.8)

## Blockers & Known Issues
- ✓ [RESOLVED] Project structure needed reorganization to follow Swift Package Manager conventions
- ✓ [RESOLVED] Package.swift had duplicate file definitions causing build errors
- ✓ [RESOLVED] MemoryMonitor class was missing several required methods causing build errors
- ✓ [RESOLVED] API inconsistencies between macOS versions (Int.random vs Bool.random)
- ⚠️ Chart API (.chartTitle) usage is incompatible with macOS 12
- ⚠️ LicenseActivationView and AuthenticationView use iOS-specific TextField modifiers
- ⚠️ TabViewStyle.page is unavailable in macOS
- ⚠️ File dropping (onDrop) implementation has compatibility issues
- ⚠️ Missing UTType implementations

## Recent Accomplishments
- Successfully reorganized project structure to follow Swift Package Manager conventions
- Fixed duplicate struct definitions (License, User) that were causing build conflicts
- Fixed circular imports between modules
- Enhanced MemoryMonitor class with proper implementation of all required methods
- Implemented type-safe batch processing for GroupableItem
- Created comprehensive test suite for MemoryMonitor class
- Updated Package.swift to reference minimum macOS 12 for better API compatibility

## Next Steps
1. Continue addressing compatibility issues in UI components:
   - Fix Chart API usage for macOS 12
   - Replace iOS-specific text field modifiers with macOS alternatives
   - Implement proper TabViewStyle for macOS
   - Fix file dropping implementation
2. Complete the test suite implementation for core components
3. Fix the exhaustive switch statements in ErrorView and ProgressView
4. Fix the missing UTType implementation in ArchiveSelectionView
