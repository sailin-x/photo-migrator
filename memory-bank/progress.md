# Progress - PhotoMigrator

## Completed Work
- Set up TaskMaster for project management:
  - Initialized TaskMaster project
  - Configured AI models (Claude 3.7 Sonnet as main, Deep Research as research, GPT-4o as fallback)
  - Created initial tasks based on project requirements
  - Generated task files
- Created memory-bank directory structure
- Populated memory-bank with initial project documentation:
  - Project Brief
  - Product Context
  - System Patterns
  - Tech Context
  - Active Context
  - Progress (this file)
- Implemented core architecture (Task 1)
- Created basic UI implementation (Task 2)
- Implemented Google Takeout archive processing (Task 3)
- Developed metadata extraction and parsing system (Task 4)
- Integrated with PhotoKit for Photos import (Task 5)
- Built Live Photo reconstruction system (Task 6)
- Implemented album recreation in Photos (Task 7)
- Created memory-efficient batch processing system (Task 8)
- Developed statistics and reporting system (Task 9)
- Implemented comprehensive error handling (Task 10)

## In Progress
- Task 16: Comprehensive Test Suite Development
  - Set up test directory structure
  - Configured Package.swift for testing
  - Implemented unit tests for core models:
    - MediaItem tests
    - MigrationProgress tests
    - MigrationError tests
  - Implemented unit tests for utilities:
    - DateTimeUtils tests
  - Implemented initial service tests:
    - MetadataExtractor tests
  - Working on resolving build issues with test suite
  - âœ… **13.9**: Fixed build issues in the test suite:
    - Fixed XCTestManifests.swift by adding missing test class references 
    - Identified and documented project structure issues causing build failures
    - Created reorganization tools and documentation for future structure improvements
  - ðŸ”„ **13.2**: Completing unit tests for models and utilities (next up)

## Pending Tasks
- Task 11: User Testing and Feedback Integration
- Task 12: Performance Optimization
- Task 13: Enhance Metadata Preservation
- Task 14: Advanced Live Photo Support
- Task 15: Final Polish and Release
- Task 17: User Documentation
- Task 18: Edge Case Handling Improvements
- Task 19: User Experience Refinements
- Task 20: Additional Privacy and Security Enhancements

## Blockers & Known Issues
- Build issues with duplicate files in the Package.swift configuration
- Need to generate realistic test data without including actual user photos
- Need to test PhotoKit integration without modifying actual Photos library
- Project structure has duplicate Swift files in different locations, causing "multiple producers" build errors
- The current Package.swift configuration is a temporary workaround
- A full reorganization to a standard Swift Package Manager structure is needed

## Milestones
- [x] Project setup with TaskMaster
- [x] Core architecture implementation
- [x] Basic workflow implementation
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite implementation (in progress: ~15% complete)
- [ ] User documentation completion
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Final polish and release 

## Recent Accomplishments

- Fixed the XCTestManifests.swift file to include all test classes (ArchiveProcessorTests and LivePhotoProcessorTests)
- Identified underlying project structure issues with duplicate Swift files
- Created documentation (PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md) explaining the issues and proposed solutions
- Developed a reorganization script (scripts/reorganize_project.sh) to help fix the structure
- Documented test suite fixes in TEST_SUITE_FIXES.md
- Updated Package.swift to temporarily work around duplicate files

## Current Focus

- Completing unit tests for models and utilities (Task 13.2)
- Implementing remaining unit tests for services
- Preparing for integration tests

## Next Steps

1. Complete unit tests for models and utilities (Task 13.2)
2. Implement remaining unit tests for services
3. Add integration tests for key workflows
4. Set up UI tests for critical user journeys
5. Address project structure issues
