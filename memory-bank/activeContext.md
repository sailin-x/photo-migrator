# Active Context

## Current Focus

We are currently working on completing compatibility fixes for the PhotoMigrator application and implementing comprehensive test coverage. Our immediate focus is addressing build errors related to SwiftUI and macOS compatibility, as well as completing the test suite for core components.

### Completed:

- Reorganized all source files to follow the proper Swift Package Manager structure:
  - Moved source files to Sources/PhotoMigrator directory
  - Moved test files to Tests/PhotoMigratorTests directory
  - Eliminated duplicate file definitions from Package.swift
- Fixed build issues:
  - Eliminated duplicate struct definitions (License, User)
  - Fixed circular imports between modules
  - Fixed Boolean.random usage with Int.random alternatives
  - Fixed async function calls in view components
  - Fixed Dispatch.DispatchQueue.async method calls
- Implemented comprehensive MemoryMonitor class:
  - Added missing methods: getMemoryUsagePercentage, reduceMemoryUsage, configureThresholds, recommendedBatchSize
  - Improved memory pressure tracking with proper callback mechanisms
  - Added support for changing batch sizes based on memory pressure
  - Created comprehensive test suite for MemoryMonitor class
- Fixed batch processing with type-erased approach for GroupableItem protocol

### In Progress:

- Fixing incompatible SwiftUI modifiers for macOS:
  - Chart API (.chartTitle) usage is incompatible
  - TextField modifiers like .keyboardType and .autocapitalization
  - TabViewStyle.page is unavailable in macOS
- Addressing file system API compatibility issues:
  - File dropping implementation with onDrop
  - UTType implementation for macOS
- Completing test suites for core components:
  - MediaItem tests
  - MigrationProgress tests
  - PhotosImporter tests
  - MetadataExtractor tests

### Next Steps:

1. Fix the most critical UI compatibility issues:
   - Chart API usage
   - File dropping implementation
   - TextField modifiers
2. Address exhaustive switch statements in ErrorView and ProgressView to handle all MigrationError cases
3. Implement complete test coverage for core functionality
4. Run a complete build with all tests to ensure everything passes

## Implementation Notes

### MemoryMonitor Improvements

The MemoryMonitor class has been extensively enhanced to provide better memory management capabilities:

- Added configurable memory pressure thresholds (mediumPressure, highPressure, criticalPressure)
- Implemented proper callbacks for both memory warnings and pressure level changes
- Added methods to calculate memory usage percentage and format memory sizes
- Created a batch size advisor that can recommend optimal batch sizes based on current memory pressure
- Replaced the outdated objc_collectingTryCollect with autoreleasepool for memory cleanup
- Added reset functionality for peak memory usage tracking

### Testing Strategy

We are implementing a comprehensive testing strategy for the core components:

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing individual classes and functions in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Testing how components work together
3. **Mocking**: Using mock implementations for system services like PhotoKit
4. **Error Handling**: Ensuring proper error handling and recovery

All tests are designed to be repeatable and not modify the user's actual Photos library or file system.

## Environment Configuration

- **Minimum macOS Version**: 12.0 (specified in Package.swift)
- **Swift Version**: 5.5+
- **Build System**: Swift Package Manager
- **Dependencies**: SwiftUI, PhotoKit, UniformTypeIdentifiers

## Testing Requirements

- Tests should not require user interaction
- Tests should not modify the actual Photos library
- Tests should clean up any temporary files created
- All tests should be idempotent (can be run multiple times with the same result)
- Test coverage should focus on core functionality first

## Project Organization

The PhotoMigrator project structure has been reorganized to follow standard Swift Package Manager conventions:
- All source files are now in `Sources/PhotoMigrator/` directory
- All test files are now in `Tests/PhotoMigratorTests/` directory
- Package.swift has been updated to correctly reference the files
- Duplicate files have been removed

This has resolved the "multiple producers" build errors. The focus now is on completing compatibility fixes to ensure the application works correctly across macOS versions.

## Work Queue

Tasks in order of priority:

1. Complete compatibility fixes for macOS 12+ (Task 13.4)
2. Finish unit tests for models and utilities
3. Implement remaining unit tests for services
4. Add integration tests for key workflows
5. Set up UI tests for critical user journeys
6. Improve edge case handling
7. Enhance user experience
8. Develop comprehensive user documentation
