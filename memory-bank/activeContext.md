# Active Context

## Current Focus

We are currently working on improving the test suite for the PhotoMigrator application (Task 13). We have just completed Task 13.9 which involved fixing build issues in the test suite.

### Completed:

- Fixed XCTestManifests.swift by adding missing test class references for ArchiveProcessorTests and LivePhotoProcessorTests
- Identified underlying project structure issues causing "multiple producers" build errors
- Created documentation explaining the project structure problems (PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md)
- Developed a reorganization script (scripts/reorganize_project.sh) to help fix the structure
- Documented test suite fixes in TEST_SUITE_FIXES.md
- Updated Package.swift to temporarily work around duplicate files

### Next Steps:

- Complete unit tests for models and utilities (Task 13.2)
- Implement remaining unit tests for services
- Add integration tests for key workflows
- Set up UI tests for critical user journeys

## Project Organization

The PhotoMigrator project structure currently has issues with duplicate Swift files in different locations:
- Files in `PhotoMigrator/` directory
- Duplicate files in `PhotoMigrator/Sources/PhotoMigrator/` directory

This is causing build failures with "multiple producers" errors. A full reorganization to a standard Swift Package Manager structure is recommended, but in the meantime we're focusing on completing the test suite implementation.

## Work Queue

Tasks in order of priority:

1. Complete unit tests for models and utilities (Task 13.2)
2. Implement remaining unit tests for services
3. Improve edge case handling
4. Enhance user experience
5. Implement additional privacy and security enhancements
6. Develop comprehensive user documentation

## Project Status

- Core functionality (Tasks 1-10): Complete
- Test suite (Task 13): In progress
- UI/UX enhancements (Task 16): Pending
- Documentation (Task 14): Pending
- Edge case handling (Task 15): Pending
- Privacy and security (Task 17): Pending

## Recent Changes

- Added missing test class references to XCTestManifests.swift
- Created documentation for project structure issues
- Developed a reorganization script to help fix the structure
- Documented test suite fixes

## Key Dependencies
