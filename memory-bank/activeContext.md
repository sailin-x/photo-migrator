# Active Context

## Current Focus

We are currently working on implementing privacy and security enhancements for the PhotoMigrator application, while also continuing with compatibility fixes and test coverage. Our immediate focus is addressing security concerns related to metadata handling, permissions management, file path security, and secure temporary file handling.

### Completed:

- Reorganized all source files to follow the proper Swift Package Manager structure:
  - Moved source files to Sources/PhotoMigrator directory
  - Moved test files to Tests/PhotoMigratorTests directory
  - Eliminated duplicate file definitions from Package.swift
- Fixed build issues:
  - Eliminated duplicate struct definitions (License, User)
  - Fixed circular imports
  - Resolved Swift 5.9 compatibility issues
  - Updated Package.swift dependencies
- Addressed compatibility fixes for older iOS versions
- Implemented secure metadata handling (Task 17.1):
  - Created MetadataPrivacyManager for sanitizing sensitive metadata
  - Added privacy controls to UserPreferences
  - Enhanced PreferencesView with privacy settings UI
  - Updated Logger to respect privacy settings
  - Modified MetadataExtractor to use privacy manager
  - Updated PhotoLibraryImporter to sanitize metadata before import

### In Progress:

- Security testing framework (Task 17.5) ▶️ Currently implementing
- Secure coding best practices (Task 17.6)

### Next Steps:

- Complete security testing framework (Task 17.5)
- Implement secure coding best practices (Task 17.6)
- Apply secure coding best practices throughout the codebase

## Development Guidelines

- Ensure all new code follows Swift 5.9 syntax and conventions
- Use SwiftUI for all new UI components
- Follow MVVM architecture for view models and data binding
- Ensure proper error handling and user feedback for all operations
- Add inline documentation for all public methods and properties
- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Pay special attention to memory management in batch processing code

## Implementation Notes

### Security Enhancement Strategy

The privacy and security enhancements will focus on several key areas:

1. **Metadata Privacy**: ✅ Implementing options to strip sensitive EXIF data like GPS coordinates
2. **Permissions Management**: ✅ Ensuring proper PhotoKit permissions handling with clear user explanations
3. **File Path Security**: ✅ Preventing path traversal attacks and ensuring secure file operations
4. **Temporary File Handling**: ✅ Ensuring secure creation, use, and deletion of temporary files with comprehensive testing
5. **Security Testing Framework**: Creating a structured approach to verify security features
6. **Secure Coding Practices**: Implementing guidelines for secure Swift development

### Standalone Testing Approach

For complex components like the SecureTempFileManager, we've implemented two testing approaches:
1. Comprehensive XCTest suite that validates all functionality in the primary test environment
2. Standalone isolated tests that can run independently of the project infrastructure, providing verification of critical security components even when other parts of the codebase may have compilation or integration issues

This dual approach ensures that security-critical components maintain their integrity throughout the development process.

### Upcoming Work

Current focus is on implementing the security testing framework (Task 17.5) which will provide a standardized approach for validating security measures throughout the application. This will be particularly important for ensuring that the metadata privacy implementation properly protects user information.

### MemoryMonitor Improvements

The MemoryMonitor class has been extensively enhanced to provide better memory management capabilities:

- Added configurable memory pressure thresholds (mediumPressure, highPressure, criticalPressure)
- Implemented proper callbacks for both memory warnings and pressure level changes
- Added methods to calculate memory usage percentage and format memory sizes
- Created a batch size advisor that can recommend optimal batch sizes based on current memory pressure
- Replaced the outdated objc_collectingTryCollect with autoreleasepool for memory cleanup
- Added reset functionality for peak memory usage tracking

### Testing Strategy

We are implementing a comprehensive testing strategy for the core components:

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing individual classes and functions in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Testing how components work together
3. **Mocking**: Using mock implementations for system services like PhotoKit
4. **Error Handling**: Ensuring proper error handling and recovery
5. **Security Testing**: Adding specific tests for security features and vulnerabilities

All tests are designed to be repeatable and not modify the user's actual Photos library or file system.

## Environment Configuration

- **Minimum macOS Version**: 12.0 (specified in Package.swift)
- **Swift Version**: 5.5+
- **Build System**: Swift Package Manager
- **Dependencies**: SwiftUI, PhotoKit, UniformTypeIdentifiers

## Testing Requirements

- Tests should not require user interaction
- Tests should not modify the actual Photos library
- Tests should clean up any temporary files created
- All tests should be idempotent (can be run multiple times with the same result)
- Test coverage should focus on core functionality first
- Security tests should validate all security enhancements

## Project Organization

The PhotoMigrator project structure has been reorganized to follow standard Swift Package Manager conventions:
- All source files are now in `Sources/PhotoMigrator/` directory
- All test files are now in `Tests/PhotoMigratorTests/` directory
- Package.swift has been updated to correctly reference the files
- Duplicate files have been removed

This has resolved the "multiple producers" build errors. The focus now is on completing compatibility fixes to ensure the application works correctly across macOS versions.
