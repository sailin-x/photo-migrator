# Product Context - PhotoMigrator

## Problem Statement
Users migrating from Google Photos to Apple Photos currently face challenges in preserving metadata, organization, and special media types. This process is often manual, time-consuming, and results in loss of valuable photo information and organization.

## User Stories
1. As a user switching from Google Photos to Apple Photos, I want to preserve all my metadata so my photo library maintains its historical context.
2. As a user with a large photo library, I want an efficient batch processing system that can handle thousands of photos without crashing.
3. As a user with organized albums in Google Photos, I want those same albums recreated in Apple Photos.
4. As a user with Live Photos or motion photos, I want these special formats correctly reconstructed in Apple Photos.
5. As a user concerned about migration success, I want detailed statistics and reporting to understand what was transferred successfully.
6. As a user dealing with Google Takeout archives, I want a simplified process to extract and process the complex archive structure.

## UI/UX Intentions
- Create a straightforward, guided workflow:
  1. Select archive
  2. Configure processing options
  3. Process files and import to Photos
  4. Review results
- Provide clear progress indicators during long-running operations
- Offer detailed statistics with visualizations for better understanding
- Ensure error messages are user-friendly with recovery suggestions
- Design an interface that respects macOS design guidelines
- Include help tooltips for technical features
